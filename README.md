# Authentication logic

- Login route calls Passport local strategy.
- On success, generate an JWT access token with a short expiry (5 min.).
- Save the access token to the response cookie with Same site set to strict.
- When navigating to protected routes, call an authentication api, that checks the access token cookie and if valid, returns a user object.
- When accessing protected api, check the access token cookie and if valid, allow access to api.
